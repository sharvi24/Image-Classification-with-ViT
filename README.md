# Image-Classification-with-ViT

In this work, we implement transformers for image classification from scratch and analyse the training performance on multiple data sets for a variety of settings. Additionally, we perform a comparison of the model performance of ViTB/16 pretrained model with our ViT Model implemented from scratch on a few selected datasets.
